# What is this

This is a small project to implement the following things as a learning exercise to understand how to write interpreters for other (more complicated languages).

- [x] A parser for BF
- [x] A barebones interpreter for BF
- [x] A IR code generator for BF with some optimization passes 
- [x] A Virtual Machine to run on the IR we generated
- [x] A REPL for BF, to run interactively in the command line
- [x] A (com/trans)piler to convert BF into another language or run natively


### Tools

### bf - A decently fast BF VM

An optimized BF VM that is based on a few simple optimization passes on the BF script. If you want to run a 
BF script, you can use the following command:

```commandline
.\bf -b <file.bf> 
```

### bfrepl - A REPL for BF

A simple REPL for BF that allows you to run BF code interactively in the command line.
It is a simple wrapper around the VM that allows you to run BF code in a more interactive way.
If you want to run the repl, you can use the following command:
```commandline
.\bfrepl 
```


### bff - A BF to C transpiler (gcc's bff)


A simple BF to C transpiler that generates C code from BF code. The generated C code can be compiled with (more or less) any C compiler.
The generated C code is based 1 to 1 on the opcodes generated by the VM, but it is a good starting point for further optimization.

If you want to run the transpiler, you can use the following command:

```commandline
.\bff -b <file.bf> -o <file.c> 
```
