# BF - What is this

This is a small incremental project to implement the following things as a learning excersise to understand how to write interpretters for other (more complicated languages).

- [x] A parser for BF
- [x] A barebones interpreter for BF
- [x] A IR code generator for BF with some optimization passes 
- [x] A Virtual Machine to run on the IR we generated
- [ ] A REPL for BF, to run interactiively in the command line
- [ ] A (com/trans)piler to convert BF into another language or run natively
